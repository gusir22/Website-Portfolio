                    From an early age, I was captivated by creating websites, starting with a basic HTML page in an FIU
                    class. My curiosity led me to self-teach Python and discover Django, which became central to my web
                    development journey. I've built practical projects, like a web app for my dad's construction
                    company, and now, as a Broward College student, I continue to expand my skills.

                    To me, web development is like constructing a buildingâ€”blending creativity, planning, and
                    functionality to create something meaningful. My goal is to develop apps that enhance productivity
                    and, one day, create a household-name website.
